Memmon

Memmon is a utility used to detect possible memory leaks in system processes.

Memmon builds a table of memory usage by process. Repeated calls to Memmon 
from cron update the table with a memory increase usage count. 
If the memory used continues to increase over time the process is flagged 
as one that may have a memory leak. This monitor works on the assumption that 
processes will use a stable amount of memory over time.

A filter is provided to eliminate noise from applications known to vary widely 
in their memory usage.
